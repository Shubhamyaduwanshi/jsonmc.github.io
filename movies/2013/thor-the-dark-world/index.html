Earth happens to be one of these realms. These realms create portals between the worlds during the alignment which is called &quot;Convergence&quot;. On Earth, in London, Jane Foster believes she and her crew have discovered one such portal. Foster, while investigating the phenomenon, is transported to another realm and comes in contact with a substance called Aether. Upon coming into contact with the substance, it draws Thor from Asgard back to Earth. Thor takes Jane to Asgard to be cured from the Aether. Unfortunately in doing so it draws more than just Jane to that world. Another being called Malekith wants to use the Aether to destroy Asgard. Devising a plan with his brother - the war criminal Loki, Thor heads to &quot;The Dark World&quot; to destroy the Aether and save Asgard. But can Loki be trusted?</div></div><div class="footer"><p>This page is part of the JSON movie collection project.</p></div></div></body></html>
