Cole is frightened by visitations from those with unresolved problems who appear from the shadows. He is too afraid to tell anyone about his anguish, except child psychologist Dr. Malcolm Crowe (Bruce Willis). As Dr. Crowe tries to uncover the truth about Cole's supernatural abilities, the consequences for client and therapist are a jolt that awakens them both to something unexplainable.</div><h3>Actors<div>Bruce Willis</div><div>Haley Joel Osment</div><div>Toni Collette</div><div>Olivia Williams</div><div>Donnie Wahlberg</div><div>Glenn Fitzgerald</div><div>Mischa Barton</div><div>Trevor Morgan</div><div>Bruce Norris</div><div>Angelica Page</div><div>Greg Wood</div><div>M.
