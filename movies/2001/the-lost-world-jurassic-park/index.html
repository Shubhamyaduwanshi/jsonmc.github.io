Grant is that happy that he announce in public, that nothing on Earth can persuade him back onto the islands. Maybe nothing, except Paul Kirby. Kirby and his wife, Amanda want a plane to fly them over Isla Sorna, with Dr. Grant as their guide. But not everything Kirby says is true. When the plane lands, Dr. Grant realizes that there is another reason why they are there, that he doesn't know of. Now, Dr. Grant is stuck on an island he has never been on before, with what was a plane journey now turned into a search party. </div><dl class="movie-data"><dt>Release Date</dt><dd>2001-07-18</dd><dt>Runtime</dt><dd>92</dd><dt>Writer</dt><dd>Michael Crichton, Peter Buchman, Alexander Payne, Jim Taylor</dd></dl><h3>Actors</h3><div class="actor-list"><ul><li><a href="/actors/sam-neill/">Sam Neill</a></li><li><a href="/actors/william-h-macy/">William H.
