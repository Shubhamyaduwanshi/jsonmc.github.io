Everything changes when Dr. Erskine recruits him for the secret Project Rebirth. Proving his extraordinary courage, wits and conscience, Rogers undergoes the experiment and his weak body is suddenly enhanced into the maximum human potential. When Dr. Erskine is then immediately assassinated by an agent of Nazi Germany's secret HYDRA research department (headed by Johann Schmidt, a.k.a. the Red Skull), Rogers is left as a unique man who is initially misused as a propaganda mascot; however, when his comrades need him, Rogers goes on a successful adventure that truly makes him Captain America, and his war against Schmidt begins.</div><h3>Actors</h3><div class="actor-list"><ul><li><a href="/actors/chris-evans/">Chris Evans</a></li><li><a href="/actors/hugo-weaving/">Hugo Weaving</a></li><li><a href="/actors/samuel-l-jackson/">Samuel L.
